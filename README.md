- 👋 Hi, I’m @bhernandezzz, I am currently working in local government! I am a data analyst, performance management analyst, and project coordinator.
- 👀 I’m interested in making my life easier by automating processes and using data science for data driven decisions.
- 🌱 I primarly use Python and R for projects, and Tableau, PowerBI, or Esri for data visualization. I am currently learning data dimension reduction techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects. Also open to low effort mentorships.
